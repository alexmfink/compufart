# CompuFart

CompuFart is a fart sound synthesizer that generates sound by physically modeling wind passing through an asshole. This version is programmed in [Cmajor](https://cmajor.dev/).

## How to Use

To use the CompuFart Synthesizer, you need to run the Cmajor patch `CompurFart.cmajorpatch`. This can be done in a DAW or other audio plug-in host by loading the patch inside of Sound Stacks' patch-hosting [plug-in](https://cmajor.dev/docs/GettingStarted#loading-patches-in-your-daw-with-the-cmajor-vstau-plugin). You can also run patches in VScode with the `Cmajor VScode extension`[https://cmajor.dev/docs/GettingStarted#using-cmajor-in-vscode]. 

Alternatively, you can use the physical model in your own Cmajor patch!
